Redis Library Services Platform
===============================

The Redis Library Services Platform includes the 
[Aristotle Library Apps](https://github.com/jermnelson/aristotle-library-apps) and the 
[BIBFRAME Datastore](https://github.com/jermnelson/BIBFRAME-Datastore) projects and is 
meant to coordinate continuous integration of these two projects.

This project also contains two light-weight web and json interfaces into the Redis
Library Services Platform. The first is a json interface to a Redis Bibliographic 
Datastore and the second is a json and html5 metadata services interface to a
scientific, cultural, social, and historical datasets. The first implementation is
a [ISA Commons](http://www.isacommons.org/) biological interface to a Redis Bibliographic
Datastore.
